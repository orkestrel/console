 * narrowed to this via {@link import('./helpers.js').isStreamTarget} (AGENTS §14 — narrow the
 * boundary, never `as`), so a test can drive either with a hand-built fake stream that never
 * touches the real `process` streams.
 *
 * @remarks
 * - `write(text)` — the one required method: push a chunk to the stream, returning the host's
 *   backpressure boolean (`false` when the kernel buffer is full). A `process` stream returns it;
 *   a fake may return `void` (read as truthy / no backpressure).
 * - `isTTY` — present and `true` on a real terminal, absent / `false` when the stream is piped to a
 *   file or another process. The sink reads it to decide whether to keep ANSI (a terminal renders
 *   it, and a leading `\r` overwrites natively) or {@link import('@src/core').strip} it to clean
 *   text (a log file should not carry escape codes).
 * - `columns` — the terminal width in character cells when the stream is a TTY, `undefined`
 *   otherwise; the sink surfaces it as {@link ServerSinkInterface.columns} so a consumer can feed a
 *   `Reporter` / `Progress` its render width.

/**
 * An observable interceptor of the RAW process output streams (AGENTS §13) — the server's

 * side), this patches `process.stdout.write` / `process.stderr.write` (the low-level stream), so it
 * catches DIRECT `process.stdout.write`, third-party library output, and child-process pipes —
 * everything that reaches the streams, not just `console.*`.
 *
 * @remarks
 * - **Snapshot-at-start (the no-capture-loop principle).** `start()` snapshots the CURRENT
 *   `process[stream].write` for each configured {@link StreamLevel}, then installs the wrappers. The
 *   mirror replays through that snapshot — so a server sink created from the same streams BEFORE the
 *   capture is never re-captured. Create your sinks before installing a capture.
 * - **Idempotent + PROCESS-GLOBAL + NON-REENTRANT.** `start()` while `active` is a no-op (never
 *   double-patches); `stop()` while inactive is a no-op. It patches the ONE global `process`, so at
 *   most ONE process capture may be active at a time — running two concurrently interleaves their
 *   buffers and clobbers each other's restore.
 * - **The wrapper NEVER throws and passes through backpressure.** A throw inside
 *   `process.stdout.write` would crash the host, so the wrapper builds its record through a total
 *   decode, and returns the snapshot-original's boolean (or `true` when mirroring is off) so a
 *   caller's backpressure handling keeps working.
 * - **Bounded buffers.** The total buffer and each per-stream bucket are each capped at `limit`
 *   (oldest dropped first), never unbounded.
 * - **Lifecycle (§10).** `start` / `stop` toggle interception (emitting `start` / `stop`);
 *   `destroy()` stops (restoring the pristine `write`) then destroys the emitter.
